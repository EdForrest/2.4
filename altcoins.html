      <b>What is an Alt-Coin?</b><br>
      The term altcoin is short for alternative coin â€” as in, an alternative to bitcoin. Altcoins also are alternatives to currencies issued by governments. However, they aren't physical coins. Like Bitcoin, altcoins are digital currencies.

      <b>What is Etherum?</b><br>
      Ethereum is a blockchain platform with its own cryptocurrency, called Ether (ETH) or Ethereum, and its own programming language, called Solidity.
      As a blockchain network, Ethereum is a decentralized public ledger for verifying and recording transactions. The network's users can create, publish, monetize, and use applications on the platform, and use its Ether cryptocurrency as payment.

      <b>Difference between coins</b><br>
      Unlike bitcoin, which has set 21 million as the finite amount of the digital currency, dogecoin has 129 billion coins in circulatIon and will continue to make new blocks of coins available to mine each year. That's part of the reason one dogecoin is currently valued at about three dimes and a bitcoin is worth about $62,000.
