        <b>Our Plan</b><br>This CryptoInfo website provides an information resource that gathers essential knowledge for crypto-beginners to consider before entering the cryptocurrency market.  This information covers the different types of Crypto Coins(Bitcoins and Altcoins) as well as the different types of Wallets to cater for different situations. All the information is from reputable sources because it is important that CryptoInfo provides reliable knowledge and education in a fast-moving and sometimes         confusing marketplace.<br><br>  /* HTML for line break(this means that I can easily format the paragraphs) */
